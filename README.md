# Image Metadata Parsing Toolkit

Welcome to the **Image Metadata Parsing Toolkit** — a Java library dedicated to extracting and analysing **Exif metadata** from various image formats, including TIFF, JPEG, PNG, and HEIF/HEIC.

This project is primarily a showcase of my programming and documentation skills, demonstrating proficiency in Java, binary file parsing, metadata standards, and producing clear, comprehensive technical documentation. It combines practical utility with clean, extensible design to solve real-world problems in image metadata extraction.

Currently, the focus is exclusively on **Exif metadata** parsing, providing reliable access to detailed camera and image capture information embedded within images.

In future development phases, support will be expanded to include other metadata formats and standards commonly used in imaging workflows, such as XMP, IPTC, and proprietary vendor metadata.

## Key Features

* Accurate extraction of Exif metadata from TIFF, JPEG, PNG, and HEIF/HEIC files
* Low-level parsing of file structures to locate and decode Exif segments or boxes
* Support for standard Exif tags with extensibility for custom metadata
* Java 8 compatible for easy integration in diverse environments
* Lightweight and modular design for efficient use in applications

Explore the full API documentation here: [Javadoc Documentation](https://trevormaggs.github.io/ImageMetadata/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trevormaggs/ImageMetadata.git
   ```
2. Import the project into your favourite Java IDE supporting Java 8 or above.
3. Review the [Javadoc documentation](https://trevormaggs.github.io/ImageMetadata/) for detailed API usage.
4. Use the library to parse Exif metadata from supported image files as needed.
